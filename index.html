            Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs(February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011)
            was an American entrepreneur and inventor,
            best known as the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc. 
            At the time of his resignation from Apple,
            and again after his death, Jobs was widely described as a visionary, pioneer,
            and genius—perhaps one of the foremost—in the field of business, innovation, and product design.
            He profoundly changed the face of the modern world and was an "exemplar for all chief executives."7
